# quiksass README

This plugin generates the .css and .min.css files for the given .scss file. It gets activated by default for .scss files.

## Features

This VSCode plugin directly depends on the native pure-javascript `sass` implementation.  So in that sense - it does not depend on node-sass or indirectly the libcss either. 

## Requirements



## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `quiksass.includePath`: Set of directories to be specified as includePath for sass compilation.
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something

## Known Issues

* Currently the version of ```sass``` package is hardcoded. It would be useful to get it automatically inferred. 

## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.

### 1.0.0
